# chef-apt-docker Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef-apt-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef-apt-docker) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/chef-apt-docker.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-apt-docker)

Configures the official Docker apt repository

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Debian
- Ubuntu

### Chef

- Chef 12+

### Cookbooks

- apt

## Attributes

- `node['chef-apt-docker']['components']` - repository components to configure. Default to ['main']. Other options are experimental and testing. Component must be an array of strings even if only a single component.

## Usage

Simply add `recipe[chef-apt-docker]` to a run list. Change the component if you want testing / experimental releases

Note: Debian 7 requires the wheezy-backports repository be setup to fully satisfy requirements of the docker packages. This cookbook does not handle that, but you will need to setup that repository if running Debian 7.
